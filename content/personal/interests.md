## Art
- I've been doodling since middle school. Procreate, Apple pencil and iPad pro made this even more fun. You can find some of my art works here: [Pinterest](https://in.pinterest.com/ksyamsundar21/my-art/)

## Elocution
- I love public speaking and giving seminars - there is something special to have a group of
people listen to what you say.

## Competitions & Meetups
- Competitions and Meetups are a great place to get in touch with people who have similar hobbies and interests.
I did make a few friends this way. I usually attend Project Display and Programming contests. I attend meetups
organized by companies who are really good at a particular tech that I'm really interested in.
