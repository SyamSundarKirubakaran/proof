### The Beginnings
- I first got access to a computer in late 90's when I was 3 years old. It was a different scene then. 
CRT monitors, dot matrix printers, floppy discs. It was also the time when GUI was rapid gaining popularity and I
particularly remember the first operating system that I ever used was MS DOS.

- Computers were also so expensive back then, luckily my mom was a biology professor in the school where I studied, who had access to these computers. I use to sneek-in with her access ID. Good times!


### Man in the Middle
- I first got exposed to C programming language in my 6th grade as a part of my lab curriculum, I also remember the name of the book - "Compugen". TBH, I was not interested in C at that time, it didn't make a lot of sense to me back then. It was not until 10th grade when I picked up special interest towards programming.

- I did spend most of my high school summer vacation learning and writing code. I picked up OOPS concepts and learnt Cpp and Java in my 10th grade.

- I did attend a number of inter and intra school compertitions in my high school. Won multiple accolades in programming and project display contest for myself and my school. I was also the co-chair of my school's cyber club.

- Of course, there should be a reason why I picked up interest towards learning all these. This might be a clich√© reason but the reason was to over come a bottle-neck I was facing in the game that I was building in my 10th summer vacation.

- I built the game in Unreal Enginer 3 (UDK), I started off with modelling and importing game assets, planning and wiring up legal player interactions, etc. Until this point I was using kismet (a flow chart like tool wherein you can apply conditions on how game should behave) - but this had serious limitations, I was not able to dynamically alter spawn points / player starts and path nodes of recently respawned players. Dwelving deep into fix this, led to OOPS concepts - as most of the entites in the game are considered as objects and instances. Then it eventually led to learning Cpp and others.

### Dawn of something big
- No matter how far we've come, there is still a long way to go. Same applies to computers, I'm really excited about what new developments in computers and tech-in-general holds for us. Either be AI, AR / VR, Robots - I'm excited for'em all. This journy has not come to an end, I'm still learning and growing like a machine learning model ;). Will keep you posted!
