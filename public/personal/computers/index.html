It was a different scene then.\nCRT monitors, dot matrix printers, floppy discs. It was also the time when GUI was rapid gaining popularity and I\nparticularly remember the first operating system that I ever used was MS DOS.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComputers were also so expensive back then, luckily my mom was a biology professor in the school where I studied, who had access to these computers. I use to sneek-in with her credentials. Good times!\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\u0022man-in-the-middle\u0022\u003eMan in the Middle\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI first got exposed to C programming language in my 6th grade as a part of my lab curriculum, I also remember the name of the book - \u0026ldquo;Compugen\u0026rdquo;. TBH, I was not interested in C at that time, it didn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense to me back then. It was not until 10th grade when I picked up special interest towards programming.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did spend most of my high school summer vacation learning and writing code. I picked up OOPS concepts and learnt Cpp and Java in my 10th grade.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did attend a number of inter and intra school compertitions in my high school. Won multiple accolades in programming and project display contest for myself and my school. I was also the co-chair of my school\u0026rsquo;s cyber club.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there should be a reason why I picked up interest towards learning all these. This might be a clich√© reason but the reason was to over come a bottle-neck I was facing in the game that I was building in my 10th summer vacation.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI built the game in Unreal Enginer 3 (UDK), I started off with modelling and importing game assets, planning and wiring up legal player interactions, etc. Until this point I was using kismet (a flow chart like tool wherein you can apply conditions on how game should behave) - but this had serious limitations, I was not able to dynamically alter spawn points \/ player starts and path nodes of recently respawned players. Dwelving deep into fix this, led to OOPS concepts - as most of the entites in the game are considered as objects and instances. Then it eventually led to learning Cpp and others.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\u0022dawn-of-something-big\u0022\u003eDawn of something big\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComputers have evolved massively since then, we literally have 200x compute power in our pockets compared to what we had in PC in late 90s. We have cloud compute, smart phones, g-suite and so on - things that I never imagined would come into existance.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how far we\u0026rsquo;ve come, there is still a long way to go. Same applies to computers, I\u0026rsquo;m really excited about what new developments in computers and tech-in-general holds for us. Either be AI, AR \/ VR, Robots - I\u0026rsquo;m excited for\u0026rsquo;em all. This journy has not come to an end, I\u0026rsquo;m still learning and growing like a machine learning model.
