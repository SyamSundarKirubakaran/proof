      <description>The Beginnings   I first got access to a computer in late 90s when I was 3 years old. It was a different scene then. CRT monitors, dot matrix printers, floppy discs. It was also the time when GUI was rapid gaining popularity and I particularly remember the first operating system that I ever used was MS DOS.
  Computers were also so expensive back then, luckily my mom was a biology professor in the school where I studied, who had access to these computers.</description>

      <description>Art  I&amp;rsquo;ve been doodling since middle school. Procreate, Apple pencil and iPad pro made this even more fun. You can find some of my art works here: Pinterest  Elocution  I love public speaking and giving seminars - there is something special to have a group of people listen to what you say.   Voice over artist (College)^  Competitions &amp;amp; Meetups  Competitions and Meetups are a great place to get in touch with people who have similar hobbies and interests.</description>

  Favorite character: Bertram Gilfoyle, Systems Engineer.
  Favorite quote: &amp;ldquo;We are addressing problems that don&amp;rsquo;t exists and solutionism at it&amp;rsquo;s worst. We are dumbing down machines that are inherently superior.&amp;rdquo;
  Cricket I do follow cricket closely and I do play cricket sometimes.</description>
